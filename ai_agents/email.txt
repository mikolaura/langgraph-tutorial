Dear Tom,

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend the meeting, which was scheduled for 10 AM at Canary Wharf. However, I would be available to meet at 12:00 PM in New York the next day if that works for you.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Sincerely,
Misko Yurii
